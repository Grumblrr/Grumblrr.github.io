  <b> <!--God I wish I had a stylesheet, too complex for this kinda thing tho-->
    Octet Rule:
    Basic rule of thumb which states that atoms want to have 8 electrons in their
    outermost shell, even at the cost of their neutral charge.

    Single Bonds:
    Bonds between two atoms using only two electrons. Smallest and weakest of all
    bonds, but also the most stable because of the incredibly low level of
    reactivity in the compound.

<!-- I am having way too much fun with this.
I mean, raw HTML isn't really that difficult, but it's still pretty freakin fun.
I even did a little basic CSS3 with the width/height thing. So, <(^-^)> -->
