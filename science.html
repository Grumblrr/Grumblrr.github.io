    Octet Rule:<br />
    Basic rule of thumb which states that atoms want to have 8 electrons in their
    outermost shell, even at the cost of their neutral charge.
    <br /><br />
    Single Bonds:<br />
    Bonds between two atoms using only two electrons. Smallest and weakest of all
    bonds, but also the most stable because of the incredibly low level of
    reactivity in the compound.
    e.x. HCL, hydrochloride.
    <br /><br />
    Double Bonds: <br />
    Bonds between two atoms using four electrons. Larger than a single bond but
    also significantly less stable; It's much more reactive than a single bond.
    e.x. CO2, carbon dioxide.
    <br /><br /><br />
    Triple Bonds:<br />
    Bond between two atoms that share three pairs of eletrons, or six total.
    Very reactive and vulnerable to compounds that take away electrons.
    e.x. C2H2, acetylene.
    <br /><br />
    Polar Covalent Bonds:<br />
    Covalent bond between atoms where some of the electrons are pulled closer
    to the atom with the largest electronegativity level, or the one that attracts
    the electrons more. Results in an atom with a subtly negative side and a
    subtly positive side.
    e.x. H2O, water
    <br /><br />
    Nonpolar Covalent Bonds:<br />
    Covalent bond where all of the atoms have equal or almost equal electronegative
    charges. Often occurs in 'gas molecules', also known as diatomic elements
    because they contain two atoms of one element.
    e.x. H2, hydrogen gas

<!-- I am having way too much fun with this.
I mean, raw HTML isn't really that difficult, but it's still pretty freakin fun.
I even did a little basic CSS3 with the width/height thing. So, <(^-^)> -->
