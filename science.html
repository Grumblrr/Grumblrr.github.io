    Octet Rule:<br />
    Basic rule of thumb which states that atoms want to have 8 electrons in their
    outermost shell, even at the cost of their neutral charge.
    <br /><br />
    Single Bonds:<br />
    Bonds between two atoms using only two electrons. Smallest and weakest of all
    bonds, but also the most stable because of the incredibly low level of
    reactivity in the compound.
    e.x. HCL, hydrochloride.
    <br /><br />
    Double Bonds: <br />
    Bonds between two atoms using four electrons. Larger than a single bond but
    also significantly less stable; It's much more reactive than a single bond.
    e.x. CO2, carbon dioxide.
    <br /><br />
    Triple Bonds:<br />
    Bond between two atoms that share three pairs of eletrons, or six total.
    Very reactive and vulnerable to compounds that take away electrons.
    e.x. C2H2, acetylene.
    <br /><br />
    Polar Covalent Bonds:<br />
    Covalent bond between atoms where some of the electrons are pulled closer
    to the atom with the largest electronegativity level, or the one that attracts
    the electrons more. Results in an atom with a subtly negative side and a
    subtly positive side.
    e.x. H2O, water
    <br /><br />
    Nonpolar Covalent Bonds:<br />
    Covalent bond where all of the atoms have equal or almost equal electronegative
    charges. Often occurs in 'gas molecules', also known as diatomic elements
    because they contain two atoms of one element.
    e.x. H2, hydrogen gas

  <b><br />Khan Academy video about electronegativity.</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>Background: <br />
  Electronegativity and something called 'electron affinity', a closely related thing. If something has a high electronegativity, it has a high electron affinity.
  When an atom is sharing electrons with another atoms, it's electronegativity represents how badly it wants to 'hog' those electrons, keeping the electrons near itself.
  Electron afginity is how much an atom 'likes' electrons, how much it wants them. Affinity is a somewhat broader notion, but the two ideas go hand in hand nonetheless.
  <br />Water is a covalent bond with two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Hydrogen will be 'happy' if it gets one more electron to form a full shell, and oxygen wants two electrons.
  When the atoms form a compound, hydrogen feels more like helium with two shared electrons each and oxygen feels like neon with a full shell of 8 electrons.
  Oxygen is significantly more electronegative than hydrogen. When they bond, oxygen 'hogs' the electrons much more than the hydrogen does, and so the electrons are 'closer' to the oxygen more of the time.
  Water has a subtle electric charge on each side because of this, which is unrelated to the current idea.
  <br /><br />So we know what electronegativity is. What are the trends found in the Periodic Table?<br />
  As you go right on the periodic table, as you increase the group number, the electronegativity values for each of the elements increases, e.g. sodium has a low negativity, chlorine has a high electronegativity.
  You could also say that it is much easier for sodium to give away an electron versus take electrons, and chlorine *wants* electrons. Sodium would give Chlorine electrons.
  <br />There is also a trend going down the periodic table.
  Cesium and lithium are in the same group, but cesium is much lower on the table than lithium is. Because cesium's electrons are further away from the nucleus, cesium has a lower electronegativity; its much more likely to give up electrons.
  The trend as you go down the periodic table is a decrease in electronegativity.
  <br /><br />
  By these trends, you can look at the periodic table and see that flourine is the most electronegative element, as it is the top-right-most element that is not a noble gas or hydrogen.
  By the same trend, you can say that Francium is the least electronegative element, as it is closest to the bottom left of the periodic table.
